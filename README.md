# ML_T20_Score_Prediction

This project predicts the scores in T20 cricket matches using machine learning techniques. The pipeline involves extracting and preprocessing data, feature engineering, and training models for accurate predictions. It leverages modern libraries and tools to create a robust and efficient prediction system.

## Features
- **Data Extraction and Preprocessing**: Processes raw match data into structured formats.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts critical features influencing T20 scores.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements models like Random Forest and XGBoost for predictions.
- **Pickle Pipeline**: Saves trained models for reuse and deployment.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Irhamul1907093/ML_T20_Score_Prediction.git
